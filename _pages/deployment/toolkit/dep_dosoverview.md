## What do I need to know? 

When a service engages a project to open their booking schedules, and allow other services to discover them and consume their resources, there are going to need to work closely with DoS leads. The way in which a service exposes their schedule resource (slots for booking into) will be entirely down to how the service discovery tool used, in the example to follow the DoS (Directory of Services), is configured.

System suppliers will build to the Booking Standard and support Service Providers to offer their schedule resource in a very granular way, splitting services using the DoS Service Id or combining them, as detailed under the <a href="fs_slotmanagement.html" target="_blank">functional specification</a>. The DoS Service Id is central to exposing the service schedules, marrying up the Service Providerâ€™s schedules with entries on the DoS.

## Configuring the DoS for Appointment Booking

### Service Attributes

The DoS supports configuration of [Attributes](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/dos-api/ccs_fields_v1.5_service_attribute.html) against a service which, in the case of appointment booking, informs system behvaiour to ensure the service is appropriately engaged with.
*NB: Not all system suppliers have implemented system behaviour based on attributes, therefore, the workflow (outlined below) cannot be guaranteed by adding this configuration to the DoS.*

The attribute used for apointment booking is entitled '**requirebooking**' and is of a boolean data type (TRUE/FALSE).

If this attribute is assigned to a service it means a referral cannot be made unless an appointment has been booked. 

### Configuring DoS
1. Find the service you wish to add the Attribute to
