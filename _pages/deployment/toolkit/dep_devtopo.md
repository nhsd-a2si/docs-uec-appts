There are several different types of deployment topologies for brokering API calls through the SSP:

### Consumer models

- [`Simple Model`](#simple-model)
- [`Aggregator Model`](#aggregator-model)

### Provider Models

- [`Single Practice System`](#single-practice-system)
- [`Data Centre Hosted Practice System`](#data-centre-hosted-practice-system)

### Consumer models

#### Simple Model

In this model, each different Care Connect consumer systems, all connecting directly to an appointment provider via the SSP. Each consumer in this example is registered as a CMA endpoint. The key point is that each consumer system has its own ASID

#### Aggregator Model

Here, several different consumer systems connect to the Spine via a single middleware instance (Message Handling Server / MHS)

### Provider Models

#### Single System Model

Here a single instance of an appointment provider system is service a single service:

#### Data Centre Hosted System Model

Finally, an appointment provider system instance hosted in a supplierâ€™s data centre. Note each individual service has a logical CMA endpoint with its own ASID but sharing the Party Key:
