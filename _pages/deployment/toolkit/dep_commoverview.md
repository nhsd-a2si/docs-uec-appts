## What is the "UEC Booking Standard"

This section will provide a brief overview of the Standard for commissioners involved in appointing Integrated Care System, supporting both patients and organisations in unifying care services. 

The UEC Booking Programme provides a Standard for system suppliers to develop booking functionality against. When software suppliers adopt interoperable booking functionality, whether to offer slots (Providers), make bookings (Consumers) or both, they are connecting services togethers; a patient who calls one service is made known to another through the act of a booking being made for them. The aim is to support standardisation for booking interoperability, enabling all systems who build to the Standard to interact without any prior knowledge of each other, removing explicit point-to-point configuration. 

Integrating care in this way supports services to provide joined up care at scale. Systems which implement the UEC Booking Standard could book with any other system in the country, which has built to the Standard, and it is being increasingly adopted within the UEC space. A full list of conformant system suppliers can be found here <URL>.

## Implementations
  
Most recently the Standard was adopted by suppliers to supported the 111 First aim of 111 service providers booking patients into Emergency Departments, rather than them turning up unannounced. This demonstrates how systems adopting the Standard can drive process and also how services can collaborate to provide an improved patient experience of joined up care. 

## Benefits

A patient’s journey is improved when services incorporate booking functionality. When a patient makes contact with one service, who after initial assessment of their needs, decides to refer them to another service, the act of make a booking for them helps bridge the gap. The receiving service will not only hold the booking but a summary of care to date, packaged as supporting clinical information to help ensure the next step in the patient journey transitions as smoothly as possible. The ambition being for the patient to feel central and services to know about them as they move between services.

Collaboration between services is enabled through adoption of the Booking Standard. Services will know upfront the patients they can expect to deal with, having the booking and supporting clinical information. In addition, they can also manage their capacity more effectively by offering or limiting available slots for the services they’re running and advertising this to other services. This helps service stop being overwhelmed and reduces a patient’s wait time by sending them to service with capacity to deal with them.

## Monitoring 

Service activity can be monitored through a suggested suite of reports <link>. System suppliers may also include additional reporting to suit service provider needs. 

If there is any particular metric not included as default but required to assist with continued commissioning of a service, we would happy to consider expanding requirements around monitoring, analytics and reporting.
