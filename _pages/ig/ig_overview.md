## Information Governance Overview

The NHS Booking Standard has had extensive review to understand the implications and context for information governance. 
<br>
This review was for the standard itself and not specific implementations that remain under the jurisdiction of the suppliers developing those solutions. The outcome of this review means that NHS Digital has not been required to prepare a DPIA for implementations of the NHS Booking Standard because no personal or special category information assets of NHS Digital were invoked or shared as a result of its operation. Local care Trusts use an NHS Booking API to share data, for which they are the controllers, through a set of infrastructure services operated by NHS Digital. The NHS Digital DPIA for those infrastructure services have been updated in a minor way and would not help in the preparation of local DPIAs. There has also been extensive clinical governance put in place including the development of a clinical safety case. This can be viewed on request.


The following diagram illustrates how data is shared using the NHS Booking Standrad within UEC:
