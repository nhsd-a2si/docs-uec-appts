TKW Simulators 
The TKW (ToolKit Workbench) Simulators are tools to assist with developing and assuring a solution to meet the Booking Standard. 
There are two tools in the suite, to support the Provider and Consumer functionality, and they can utilised locally or with the dedicated environments – OpenTest, DEV or INT. 
Within these environments they are supported by the other services – DoS, SDS and SSP – to replicate as near to like-live scenarios as possible. 

What are they?
Fundamentally, the TKW Simulators are containers (Docker) which neatly package all required resources, irrespective of the environment they are run on. 
There are two containers to replicate the Provider and Consumer aspects of functionality and the links to each of them can be found under the Resources section.
