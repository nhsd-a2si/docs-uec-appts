## Introduction

The <a href="https://nhsconnect.github.io/FHIR-SpineCore/ssp_overview.html" target="_blank">Spine Secure Proxy (known as the "SSP")</a> is a forward HTTP proxy which will be used to control and protect access to principal IT systems that expose FHIR based RESTful APIs.

In the case of Urgent & Emergency Care Appointment Booking these APIs are published by provider systems.

For more information please see the [Spine Secure Proxy Implementation Guide](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/spine-core-1-0/ssp_implementation_guide.html) and the [Urgent & Emergency Care Appointment Booking Workflow and Interactions](/fs_workflow.md)
