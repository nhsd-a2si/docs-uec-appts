* All times included in the API messages MUST be in FHIR Instant format (```YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sss+zz:zz```) 
  * e.g. ```YearMonth-DayTHours:Minutes:Seconds.miliseconds+OffsetFromUTC``` 
  * e.g. ```201502-07T13:28:17.239+02:00```
  * *except* where specifically defined otherwise (e.g. Appointment.created)
* All times SHOULD be converted to UTC from local times (if not stored locally in UTC) before being included in any messages, this means the offset should be zero
* When receiving a time in a message a system MUST expect and handle a non UTC time (e.g. with a non-zero offset)
  * Therefore if a time is received that is not UTC, the receiver should convert the time back to UTC using the offset given (or to their local time, if storing times in a local time)

{% include important.html content="This means both Consumer and Provider systems MUST be able to handle a time provided with an offset from UTC that differs from your local server time. As an illustration, if you store all times in UTC and someone uses a time specifying an offset, you will need to convert it to UTC when you store it." %}
