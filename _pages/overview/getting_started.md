### Context 
The aim of this programme of work is to deliver a standard for direct appointment booking within the UEC landscape, to improve patient experience of service through connected care paths. 
The standard ensures suppliers build compatible systems to both provide appointment slots and consume the advertised availability by requesting appointments. 


### Functionality 
The functionality Suppliers adopt is that of Consumer and/or Provider. The functions for each are different aspects of the same workflow, namely, providing available slots and managing bookings within those slots. 

#### Provider
As a Provider, a supplier will perform the following key functions: 
*	Offer Slots to Consumers
*	Create Booking
*	Cancel Booking
*	Receive Referral

#### Consumer
As a Consumer, a supplier will perform the following key functions: 
*	Service discovery (DoS)
*	Endpoint discovery (SDS)
*	Request Slots
*	Request Booking
*	Cancel Booking
*	Within consultation 
*	Outside consultation
*	Send Referral


### Standard - Implementation Guide 
The overall [Standard](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/uec-appointments/) covers the context in which the functionality is intended to be used, the scope of functionality and how a supplier is expected to engage to deliver a successfully assured solution for their customer base. It can be thought of as an implementation guide, covering every step a supplier can expect to traverse from analysis through to deployment. 

#### Functional Scope 
This Standard supports the implementation of UEC bookings, which includes **Slot Management**, **Appointment Management** and **Analytics & Reporting**, related to these activities. 
Additionally, it provides guidance on how to interact with national services (**DoS**, **SDS** & **SSP**) which support the implementation of the above functions. 

#### Capabilities 
The Standard has core use cases which suppliers must satisfy for their solution to be successfully assured. The capabilities overlap for Providers and Consumers but both having distinct roles in the workflows. <The are outlined in the Functionality section of this of this guide.> 
  
* Display Provider services based on clinical need (Consumer)
*	Offer (Provider) and display (Consumer) available slots
*	Request (Consumer) and Create (Provider) Booking
*	Request (Consumer) and Cancel (Provider) Booking inside and outside assessment made by the Consumer
*	Request (Consumer) and Rebook (Provider) Booking inside assessment
*	Notify user when Booking outside of an assessment timeframe (Consumer)
*	Support Booking Only service requirements (Consumer)

#### Interactions
The Standard can only be fulfilled at present in conjunction with additional National and Spine services.

###### DoS - Directory of Services
The DoS is required to find the Provider services and, therefore, the slots they provide for the various schedules. 
The functionality of the DoS also enables support for Booking Only services and Consumer systems will need to 

##### SDS - Spine Directory Service 
This LDAP service provides a directory of endpoints for Provider systems. The DoS will hold the require Accredited System IDdentifier (ASID) which can then be used to query SDS and retrieve the endpoint. 

##### SSP – Spine Secure Proxy 
This proxy controls all traffic from Consumers to Providers, handling both the auth-n and auth-z functions. 

#### Referrals 
The Standard supports the ability to include a reference to any referral documents which might be sent in conjunction with the Booking. In order to support a cross-reference, it is expected the Referral document will contain reference to the Booking.

#### Reporting 
There is a requirement to support reporting from both Consumer and Provider perspectives. Full details for each can be found <here>


### Specification 
The [Specification](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/nhsbooking-2.0.1-beta/) is a technical document which explicitly details the resources and structures provided, consumed and interchanged within workflows, the requirements for implementing workflows etc. <REST operations>

#### Resources 
NHS FHIR Booking API is based on STU3 FHIR Resources. The StructureDefinitions for each resource can be found in the Specification along with an overview of the dependencies and those mandated. 
A key resource is the Appointment resource which differs slightly from other resources in that it can be constructed using contained resources.

#### Implementation 
The Specification also includes a guide to development which describes the implementation of key capabilities and how these work for both Provider and Consumer perspectives. As you would expect, the guide specifies the explicit technical detail for making and consuming the various requests and responses including interactions with external services – SDS & SSP. 
For any Developer involved in the project, this will be a key resource.
<Only to define REST operations, GET, PUT, POST>

### Testing & Assurance
Quality Assurance is a key part of any development and the UEC Booking Team have a range of options to support you in this area. 

#### Environments
There are numerous environments to assist with all levels of development maturity. There aren’t any documented barriers-to-entry for any of these environments but you will work closely with the Team to establish when access is appropriate based on development progress. 

##### UEC Booking Demonstrator (deprecated) 
This Demonstrator provides an internet facing implementation of the NHS FHIR Booking API to start development against. It provides a Postman collection and place to generate valid JWT Bearer tokens new implementations would be expected to generate and validate. 

##### Spine INT
This environment is within HSCN with connectivity to like-live production services of DoS, SDS and SSP. It is a more mature environment than the Demonstrator and would only expect to be accessed when a solution is nearing the first draft of completion and can work end-to-end. 
In order to access it, you will be required to speak to a member of the UEC Booking Team who can make the necessary arrangements for your system to engage with this environment.
Any development must be tested within the INT environment before it could be assured and expect to move to an FoT Production with a customer.

#### Assurance 
Assurance is a vital part of developing a solution. A supplier will not be able to move into a Production environment with their customer base until assurance is complete. 
The process of assurance has been designed to be lightweight and driven at the pace of the supplier so they’re not held up in anyway. The principle is the supplier to self-assure and provide documentation for NHS Digital Solution Assurance Team to review and verify. A key document in the process is the SCAL.  

#### SCAL – Supplier Conformance Assessment List 
The SCAL document is for a supplier to complete, stating they support the various documented capabilities. Alongside this document, is the requirement for evidence and supporting diagrams to be provided, enabling the Solution Assurance Team to understand the solution and ensure it meets the required standard. 
In addition, the supplier will demonstrate an end-to-end test of their solution functionality within the INT environment, following given test scripts.
 
#### Tooling
Along with the internet facing Demonstrator environment, there is also the Assurance Tool. This is a series of Docker containers which simulate the various use cases for Providers and Consumers, outputting evidence (which can be supplied as part of the SCAL) and providing detailed reports on where a solution meets the standard or not. Therefore, this tool can also be used during any stage of development for either set of capabilities – Provider or Consumer.

### Deployment 
There are several aspects to deployment, involving multiple teams for various services. As a supplier, there are various stages to a successful Production deployment, which will involve deployments to INT in the process. 

#### FoT – First of Type
There is a dedicated Deployment Toolkit to help guide through the initial phases for the various actors involved in getting a supplier to Production. 
The UEC Booking Team will assist initial First-of-Type provider test, orchestrating the various parties involved, imparting information around key roles and responsibilities to enable subsequent go-lives to happen without the Booking Team being involved. 
The Toolkit provides and advice and guidance for subsequent deployment to  – 
*	Suppliers 
*	Providers
*	DoS Leaders 
*	Commissioners 
<roles and responsibilities for all parties involved in deployments – suppliers/NHS Digital etc. INT/Provider Testing/Production>

### Communication 
It is expected engagement with the UEC Booking Team will be ongoing throughout the development process and to support this we offer plan to support. 
*	Communication Plan
*	Teams Channel – continuously monitored and updated
*	Weekly calls – to mark progress and allow discussion 
*	Ad hoc calls – to be arranged if blockers occur
