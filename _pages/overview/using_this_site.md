To help get the most out of the published resources, understanding what exists and how they are intended to be used is documented here. There are two core resources - 

## * Standard
This site, which can be thought of as an [**implementation guide**](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/uec-appointments/), covering everything from use cases for booking through to the what an authentication token needs to include. 

It should be used to guide the analysis and define the scope of a solution, initially. **Developers** will need to use it in conjunction with the *Specification* (outlined below) to understand workflow, error handling and non-functional requirements a solution needs to fulfil. There are resources for **Project Managers** (and stakeholders) who are involved in moving the solution to live environments, namely the <a href="deployment_toolkit.html" target="_blank">Deployment Toolkit</a>.

## * Specification 
A [**technical document**](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/nhsbooking-2.0.1-beta/) which explicitly defines the NHS FHIR(STU3) Booking API resources and structures, along with the method operations (GET, PUT & POST) used

## Planning a project 
There is a <a href="getting_started.html" target="_blank"><strong>Quick Start Guide</strong></a> which guides suppliers through all key areas of a project when building a solution. This should be reviewed in detail as part of the analysis process and subsequent project planning. It is also a useful resource to return to at any of the project phases for quick overview and links to more detailed resources.
