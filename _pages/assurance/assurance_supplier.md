## Technical accreditation 
Consuming supplier systems **MUST** have been tested and accredited to establish baseline Spine connectivity prerequisites:

## Technical conformance 
Supplier systems SHALL be tested for technical conformance of the following before they can be listed on the conformance catalog:

* Spine Security Proxy (SSP) integration
* NHS FHIR Scheduling API specification

## Solution assurance 
Solution assurance ensures that the correct level of safety, governance, and security has been accepted, understood and signed off by the organisation providing the APIs.

## Witness testing 
Supplier systems **SHALL** undergo witness testing to validate conformance to requirements which canâ€™t easily be automated.
