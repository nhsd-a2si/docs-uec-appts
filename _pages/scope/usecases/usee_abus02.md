## ABUS.02 Display Appt Availability Status of Providers
**_In order_** that the patient can quickly be informed of what services have free appts and the call can be completed more quickly

**_As a_** 111 Call Handler or urgent care service provider

**_I want_** to view the appt availability of all the provider services that could currently assist the patient with a certain disposition when, or shortly after, that list is returned from the DoS.

### Commentary
Suppliers of consumer systems may wish to consider whether they wish to immediately access the provider systems listed to, for example, return a simple count of the number of appts that are available at the provider during the disposition timeframe.  Suppliers may wish to return and display the DoS data and then follow-up with the counts of free appts as the API calls are successfully made and returned.

The user interface could also show all the ‘next available appointment within time frame’ displayed for each individual location. so they don’t have to hunt through various diaries to find a slot.

During conversation with the patient, it is possible that the situation will change.  Suppliers of consumer software may wish to consider whether they can offer a manual or automatic refresh facility for this list.

Suppliers (and users) should be mindful that some scenarios for returning appointments may return more 'possible' appointments than the user may actually wish to choose from.  For example, an occasion where a GP practice returns all available appointments for the practice, but in reality the user is only interested in those appointments for a specific branch surgery.

### Acceptance Criteria
* The list **may** include details of free appts available at this DoS location, such as the count of free appts available at each location, within the current disposition timeframe.
* The list **may** include the earliest appt time available at each location, within the current disposition timeframe.
* This list **may** be capable of being quickly refreshed by the user or automatically as a timed event.
