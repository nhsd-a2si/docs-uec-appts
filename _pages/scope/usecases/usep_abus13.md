## ABUS.13 Booking outside an assessment outcome timeframe

**_In order_** that bookings are not made outside an assessment outcome timeframe 

**_As a_** Integrated Urgent Care Service Provider

**_I want_** to be notified when selecting an appointment booking timeslot when it is over the assessment outcome timeframe 

### Commentary

Notifications are only applicable to non-clinical users and any booking outside the assessment outcome timeframe should be logged and auditable. 

A notification and prompt to seek clinical approval to book outside the assessment outcome timeframe will be needed for assessment outcomes that require further treatment up to 6 hours. 

Users will be need to be notified when booking outside the assessment outcome timeframe for assessment outcomes from 6 hours to 12 hours. 

### Acceptance Criteria

*	The system **must** allow clinical users to book outside the assessment outcome timeframe

*	The system **must** present to the user a notification for outcomes between 6 and 12 hours
