Here you will find the main user stories that define the capabilities for solutions compliant with this standard. They are broken into two sections priority capabilities and emerging capabilities. 

The reason why they are separated into two sections is the prioirty capabilities described by the use cases in this section form the minimum viable product for these standards. The first beta deployments will be implemented with *at least* these capabilities. 

The use cases describing the emerging capabilities are intended to be included in the first stable release of the standard. However they are much more challenging to implement and require more time to specificy and implement therefore they are not mandatory for the pre-release beta implementations.

You can access the use cases using the menu on the left of the screen.
