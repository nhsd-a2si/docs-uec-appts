## Assurance principles 
High-level design principles related to the assurance processes 
* assurance should be lightweight but appropriate 
* testing should be automated where possible to establish technical conformance 
* a level of self-certified solution assurance will be made available to organisations deploying the APIs 
* all artefacts related to assurance and testing should be made available as part of the ecosystem (public domain) prior to engaging in a formal NHS Digital assurance process 
* a set of evidence based around self-assurance activities will speed up the assurance process
